# API Frontend

Constantly pools API and displays the messages received.

## How to use


## TODO

- [ ] html page calls API and displays JSON
- [ ] auto refresh that page every 3 sec
- [ ] test page with slow connection
- [ ] test page with no connection
- [ ] test several tabs open calling the same API (load)
- [ ] parse response JSON into records
- [ ] make it pretty with bootstrap
